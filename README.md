# Job-Search
Filtering and visualization tool meant to support job search for postions with a single company.

Publicly available information is compiled and merged with geo-spatial data. Using leaflet a tool was created to help visualize the geo-spatial job data. Filtering and visualizing publicly available job data from a single company can help identify open jobs of interest at a single company. Alternatively this could be used to support informing a potentially uncertain relocation decision.

The filtering occurs within the R code itself, but I could be incorporated that into a the interactive interface for more robust interaction.
